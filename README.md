# Diamonds-Analysis
Analysis of the diamonds dataset available in R
# *Introduction*
To iterate the words of John Tukey , _"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device"_. This R Markdown document is an analysis output based on the data frame from ggplot. The data frame consists of 5390 rows and 10 variables.
The variables are as follows:

* price - price in US dollars (\$326–\$18,823).
* carat - weight of the diamond (0.2–5.01).
* cut - quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
* color - diamond colour, from D (best) to J (worst).
* clarity - a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1,VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)).
* x - length in mm (0–10.74).
* y - width in mm (0–58.9).
* z - depth in mm (0–31.8).
* depth - total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43–79).
* table - width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43–95).


## *Objectives*.

* Observe the distribution of clarity.
* Investigate the relationship between price and clarity.
* Observe the distribution and relationship of cut and price.
* Investigate the relationship between cut, colour and price.
* Perform normality diagnosis on carat and price.
* Compare the differences between price and carat with their logarithms.
* Model Building by performing linear regression .
